Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis

#### Implemented Face Recognition by applying PCA where every image in the training set is represented as a linear combination of weighted eigenvectors called eigenfaces. Best match of the training dataset is found by calculation of Euclidean Distance.


## Dataset

Datasets consist of faces of 40 people and each person has ten frontal
images with varying facial expressions and lighting conditions. Thus,
there are total 400 full frontal face images manually registered and cropped.
